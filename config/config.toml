# Below are all the sections and options you can have in ~/.streamlit/config.toml.

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# Configure the ability to share apps to the cloud.
# Should be set to one of these values: - "off" : turn off sharing. - "s3" : share to S3, based on the settings under the [s3] section of this config file. - "file" : share to a directory on the local machine. This is meaningful only for debugging Streamlit itself, and shouldn't be used for production.
# Default: "off"
sharingMode = "off"

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
logLevel = "info"


[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true
caching = true

# If false, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: true
displayEnabled = true


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = true

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true


[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. This impacts both "Run on Save" and @st.cache.
# Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.
# Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder']
# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = []

# Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off completely.
# Allowed values: * "auto" : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available. * "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module. * "poll" : Force Streamlit to always use polling. * "none" : Streamlit will not watch files.
# Default: "auto"
fileWatcherType = "auto"

# If false, will attempt to open a browser window on start.
# Default: false unless (1) we are on a Linux box where DISPLAY is unset, or (2) server.liveSave is set.
headless = true

# Immediately share the app in such a way that enables live monitoring, and post-run analysis.
# Default: false
liveSave = false

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
runOnSave = false

# The address where the server will listen for client and browser connections. Use this if you want to bind the server to a specific address. If set, the server will only be accessible from this address, and not from any aliases (like localhost).
# Default: (unset)
#address =

# The port where the server will listen for browser connections.
# Default: 8501
port = 8501

# The base path for the URL where Streamlit should be served from.
# Default: ""
baseUrlPath = ""

# Enables support for Cross-Origin Request Sharing, for added security.
# Default: true
enableCORS = true

# Max size, in megabytes, for files uploaded with the file_uploader.
# Default: 200
maxUploadSize = 200


[browser]

# Internet address where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the app. Can be IP address or DNS name and path.
# This is used to: - Set the correct URL for CORS purposes. - Show the URL on the terminal - Open the browser - Tell the browser where to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.
# Default: 'localhost'
serverAddress = "localhost"

# Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit.
# Default: true
gatherUsageStats = true

# Port where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the app.
# This is used to: - Set the correct URL for CORS purposes. - Show the URL on the terminal - Open the browser - Tell the browser where to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.
# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.
serverPort = 8501


[mapbox]

# Configure Streamlit to use a custom Mapbox token for elements like st.deck_gl_chart and st.map. If you don't do this you'll be using Streamlit's own token, which has limitations and is not guaranteed to always work. To get a token for yourself, create an account at https://mapbox.com. It's free! (for moderate usage levels)
# Default: ""
token = ""


[s3]

# Name of the AWS S3 bucket to save apps.
# Default: (unset)
#bucket =

# URL root for external view of Streamlit apps.
# Default: (unset)
#url =

# Access key to write to the S3 bucket.
# Leave unset if you want to use an AWS profile.
# Default: (unset)
#accessKeyId =

# Secret access key to write to the S3 bucket.
# Leave unset if you want to use an AWS profile.
# Default: (unset)
#secretAccessKey =

# The "subdirectory" within the S3 bucket where to save apps.
# S3 calls paths "keys" which is why the keyPrefix is like a subdirectory. Use "" to mean the root directory.
# Default: ""
keyPrefix = ""

# AWS region where the bucket is located, e.g. "us-west-2".
# Default: (unset)
#region =

# AWS credentials profile to use.
# Leave unset to use your default profile.
